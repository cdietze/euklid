# Pythagoras.kt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cdietze/pythagoras.kt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cdietze/pythagoras.kt)

Pythagoras.kt is a collection of geometry classes that aims to provide performant,
portable geometry routines. Written in Kotlin.

It is a port in Kotlin of the [Pythagoras project in java](https://github.com/samskivert/pythagoras).
It is still in early development. The idea is to make it usable in both JVM and JS.
